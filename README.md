  <h1 align=center>Roblox Studio Mod Manager</h1>
</p>

>This program is an unofficial custom launcher for Roblox Studio that allows you to override files in Roblox Studio's directory.
It runs and installs 100% independent of Roblox Studio's standard launcher, and it applies updates incrementally to a single directory. 
It also provides a flexible Fast-Variable editor, smooth transitions between test builds of Roblox Studio (gametest1-gametest5), support for launching from the website, and the option to run on Roblox's 'future-is-bright' lighting prototype.

# NOTICE
I haven't signed the exe yet, so Windows Smartscreen might complain when you try to run it. 
I'm an amateur when it comes to this kind of stuff, so I apologize if there was any confusion.
This should be fixed soon!
