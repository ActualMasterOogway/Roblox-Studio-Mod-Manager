# What is this?

The _Roblox Studio Mod Manager_ is an unofficial, open-source, custom bootstrapper for Roblox Studio that aims to provide more flexibility for power users who want to make experimental customizations to Roblox Studio, and test new features before they are available to the public.

# Features
* Runs and installs in a separate directory, 100% independent of Roblox Studio's bootstrapper.
* File overrides are sustained between updates.
* Updates are applied incrementally to a single directory.
* Provides a flexible flag editor, allowing you to toggle engine features.
* Provides a tool for integrating custom class icons into Roblox Studio's explorer.
* Smooth transitions between development builds of Roblox Studio.
* Support for launching from the website, and from saved _RBXL_ files.
* File updates from Roblox's deployment servers are only applied where needed.
