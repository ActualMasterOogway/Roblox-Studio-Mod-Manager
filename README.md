# What is this?

The _Roblox Studio Mod Manager_ is an unofficial custom launcher for Roblox Studio that allows you to override files in Roblox Studio's directory.

# Features
* Runs and installs 100% independently of Roblox Studio's standard launcher.
* File overrides are sustained between updates.
* Updates are applied incrementally to a single directory.
* Provides a flexible FVariable editor, allowing you to toggle engine features.
* Smooth transitions between test builds of Roblox Studio (gametest1-gametest5),<br/>as well as Roblox's ***future-is-bright*** lighting prototype.
* Support for launching from the website, and from saved _RBXL_ files.

# (Notice about application signature)
I haven't signed this exe yet, so Windows Smartscreen might complain when you try to run it.<br/>
I'm an amateur when it comes to this kind of stuff, so I apologize if theres any confusion.<br/>
I'll have this fixed as soon as I figure out what I'm doing ;)
