# What is this?

The _Roblox Studio Mod Manager_ is an unofficial, open-source, custom bootstrapper for Roblox Studio that aims to provide more flexibility for power users who want to make experimental customizations to Roblox Studio, and test new features before they are available to the public.

# Features
* Runs and installs in a separate directory, 100% independent of Roblox Studio's bootstrapper.
* File overrides are sustained between updates.
* Updates are applied incrementally to a single directory.
* Provides a flexible flag editor, allowing you to toggle engine features.
* Provides a tool for integrating custom class icons into Roblox Studio's explorer.
* Smooth transitions between development builds of Roblox Studio.
* Support for launching from the website, and from saved _RBXL_ files.
* File updates from Roblox's deployment servers are only applied where needed.

# ANTI-VIRUS DISCLAIMER

If you have an anti-virus program installed, it may flag this program as malicious due to this application being misdiagnosed as a trojan horse. It was flagged as such due to the fact that it installs Roblox Studio's files from Amazon S3 and executes them from the mod manager itself. I've attempted to get this cleared several times, but haven't had any luck so far. I may need to get the application signed by a proper certificate authority, which will cost me some money to do.
