This is a setup I created to let me run custom extensions in a CoreScript context from Roblox Studio, without interrupting any of Roblox's CoreScript code.
It comes with a CoreScript command bar that can be used as long as there isn't any NetworkClient present.

To install this:

- Launch the Mod Manager
- Click **Manage Mod Files**
- Copy the `scripts` and `textures` folder into your mod folder's `content` folder.
