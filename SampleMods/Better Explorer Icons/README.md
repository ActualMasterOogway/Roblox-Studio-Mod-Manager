# Better Explorer Icons

This is my custom configuration for Roblox Studio's Class Icons.
To install them:

- Launch the Mod Manager
- Click **Open Mod Folder**
- Copy `BuiltInPlugins` and `ReflectionMetadata.xml` into your mod folder
- Open the provided `ExplorerIcons` folder
- Copy the icons in that folder to your clipboard
- Click **Edit Class Icons** in the mod manager
- Click **Open Explorer Icon Folder**
- Paste the icons from your clipboard into that folder
